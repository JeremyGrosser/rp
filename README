This is a proof of concept for running Ada on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 Pico board.

The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads the first 256 bytes from
an external SPI flash which is expected to be a stage 2 bootloader that
configures the XIP_SSI peripheral for the specific flash chip in use then
relocates the vector table to the flash memory.

The Makefile builds the pico-sdk and runs the gcc preprocessor to generate
boot2.S. crt0.S has been manually patched and is not currently auto-generated.
